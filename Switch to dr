Switching over an Oracle database from the Primary (Prod) to the Standby (DR) involves a controlled process, typically used during planned maintenance or testing. Below are the detailed steps with pre-checks and post-checks, explained in Hinglish:


---

Pre-checks (Important Steps Before Switchover)

1. Verify Data Guard Configuration

Primary aur Standby systems ki configuration check karo using:

SHOW CONFIGURATION;



2. Verify Primary and Standby Status

Primary par DATABASE_ROLE check karo:

SELECT DATABASE_ROLE, OPEN_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;

Result: PRIMARY

Standby par:

SELECT DATABASE_ROLE, OPEN_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;

Result: PHYSICAL STANDBY aur mode READ ONLY WITH APPLY.



3. Archive Log Gap Check

Ensure no log gaps between Primary aur Standby:

SELECT THREAD#, SEQUENCE# FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG WHERE APPLIED = 'NO';



4. Force Log Archive

Primary database par manual log switch karo aur Standby par lagao:

ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;



5. Check Data Guard Sync

Verify real-time apply:

SELECT DEST_ID, STATUS, ERROR FROM V$ARCHIVE_DEST WHERE TARGET = 'STANDBY';



6. Backup the Databases

Dono Primary aur Standby ka RMAN backup ensure karo as a precaution.



7. Disable Application Connections

Application ya end-users ka access restrict karo.

Switchover Steps (Switch from Prod to DR)

1. Check Switchover Readiness on Primary
Primary database par execute:

SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;

Result: TO STANDBY


2. Perform Switchover on Primary
Primary ko Standby banane ke liye:

ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY;


3. Shutdown and Startup on Former Primary
Primary ko mount mode mein le jao:

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;


4. Activate Standby as Primary
Standby database par switchover commit karo:

ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY;


5. Open New Primary Database
Standby (jo ab Primary hai) ko open karo:

ALTER DATABASE OPEN;


6. Restart Former Primary as Standby
Pehle Primary ko Standby mode mein lagao:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT;

Post-checks (Validate New Roles and Sync)

1. Verify New Roles

New Primary:

SELECT DATABASE_ROLE, OPEN_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;

Result: PRIMARY

New Standby:

SELECT DATABASE_ROLE, OPEN_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;

Result: PHYSICAL STANDBY



2. Test Log Transport and Apply

New Primary par manual log switch karo:

ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;

Ensure logs are applied on the new Standby.



3. Monitor Data Guard Configuration

SHOW CONFIGURATION;


4. Enable Application Connections

Application ka traffic new Primary par redirect karo.



5. Check Performance and Alerts

Alert logs and system performance check karo to ensure smooth operations.



6. Backup the New Primary Database

Nai Primary database ka full backup le lo.

Notes

Fast-Start Failover: Agar enabled hai, manually intervention ki zarurat nahi hoti.

Always perform switchover during low activity hours.

Use DGMGRL tool for automated commands if required.
